# cos - Coding and Operations Sage

**cos** is your typical nagging sage, throwing intelligent and wise quotes at you. He gets his wisdom from hundreds of years of accumulated knowledge... also called the *Internet*.

Things he's nagging about:

* Reminders of clean code practices
* Reminders of your operations duties
* Inspirational quotes

## Motivation

The *tech* industry, as most industries, has many intelligent quotes, design patterns, industry standards, rules, ... I gave up a long time ago remembering what I even had for breakfast yesterday and I'm supposed to keep all those things in my head and constantly reminding myself of them too? Not a chance, so that is why **cos** was born.
